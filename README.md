# CRC-8-and-7-bit-Hamming-code

<h2> CRC-8 </h2>
CRC-8 developed using C++ allows user to detect occurence of any errors during the transmission of the digital signal by appending some zeroes and using generator(x^8+x^2+x+1) to generate the codeword.

<h2> 7-Bit Hamming code </h2>  
7-Bit hamming code developed using c++ detects errors and corrects if any by first tokenizing the given stream into 4 bits, encoding them into 7 bits by adding 3 parity bits.
